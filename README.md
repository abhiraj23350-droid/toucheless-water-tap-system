🚰 Touchless Water Tap System 

🔹 Introduction

Touchless Water Tap System is an automatic water dispensing system that works without physical touch.
This project uses a sensor and Arduino to detect the presence of hands and automatically turns the water ON or OFF.
It helps in saving water and maintaining proper hygiene, especially in public places.

🔹 Objective of the Project

The main objectives of this project are:

To reduce water wastage

To provide a touch-free water system

To improve hygiene

To introduce automation using Arduino

🔹 Components Used

The following components are used in this project:

Arduino UNO

IR Sensor

Relay Module

Water Pump / Solenoid Valve

Power Supply

Connecting Wires

🔹 Working Principle

The working of the Touchless Water Tap System is very simple:

The IR sensor continuously checks for any object in front of it.

When a hand comes near the sensor, it sends a signal to the Arduino.

Arduino processes the signal and activates the relay module.

The relay turns ON the water pump or solenoid valve.

Water starts flowing automatically.

When the hand is removed, the sensor stops detecting.

Arduino turns OFF the relay, and water flow stops.

Thus, water flows only when needed.

🔹 Circuit Explanation

The IR sensor is connected to the Arduino input pin.

The relay module is connected to an output pin of Arduino.

The water pump is controlled using the relay.

Arduino acts as the brain of the system.

🔹 Applications

This system can be used in:

Public washrooms

Homes

Hospitals

Schools and colleges

Offices

🔹 Advantages

Saves water 💧

Touch-free system

Improves hygiene

Low cost

Easy to use

🔹 Limitations

Sensor may get affected by strong sunlight

Requires continuous power supply

🔹 Future Scope

Can be connected to IoT for monitoring water usage

Solar panel can be added

More accurate sensors can be used

🔹 Conclusion

The Touchless Water Tap System is a useful automation project that helps save water and maintain hygiene.
It is easy to build and suitable for real-life applications.
This project shows how Arduino can be used to create smart solutions for daily life problems.
