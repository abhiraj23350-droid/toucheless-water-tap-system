# 🚰 Touchless Water Tap System

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is an automatic touchless water tap system that uses a sensor to detect hand movement and control water flow.  
It helps in saving water and improves hygiene.

## 🎯 Objective
- Reduce water wastage
- Provide contactless water flow
- Improve hygiene in public places

## ⚙️ Components Used
- Arduino UNO
- IR Sensor
- Relay Module
- Solenoid Valve / Water Pump
- Power Supply
- Jumper Wires

## 🛠️ Working Principle
1. IR sensor detects hand movement.
2. Arduino processes the signal.
3. Relay turns ON the valve/pump.
4. Water flows automatically.
5. When hand is removed, water stops.
